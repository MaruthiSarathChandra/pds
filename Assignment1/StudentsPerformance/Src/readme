The bar plot comparing average scores based on test preparation course completion simplifies analysis by clearly showing whether students who completed
the course performed better in math, reading, and writing than those who did not. It provides a quick assessment of how test preparation influences student performance. 
The chart enables easy comparison between groups without requiring complex interpretation. By directly illustrating the impact of external preparation on scores, 
it offers valuable insights for educators and students. This simple yet powerful visualization helps identify the effectiveness of extra preparation in improving 
academic success, making it an essential tool for analysis. 

	Histogram - Distribution of Math Scores
•	Helps visualize the overall distribution of students’ math scores.
•	Identifies the most common score ranges (e.g., do most students score in the 70-80 range?).
•	Detects skewness or abnormalities in the score distribution.
	Boxplot - Scores by Gender
•	Shows the median, quartiles, and outliers for math, reading, and writing scores across genders.
•	Helps identify whether there is a significant performance difference between male and female students.
•	Detects outliers (students with extremely high or low scores).

	Bar Plot - Impact of Test Preparation Course
•	Compares average math, reading, and writing scores between students who completed the test preparation course vs. those who didn’t.
•	Helps assess whether taking the course improves performance in all subjects or just one.
•	Highlights the effectiveness of preparatory courses in boosting scores.

	Scatter Plot - Correlation Between Math and Reading Scores
•	Shows the relationship between math scores and reading scores.
•	Helps determine if students who perform well in one subject tend to perform well in the other.
•	Color-coded by gender to observe any gender-based trends.

	Heatmap - Correlation Between All Scores
•	Displays correlation coefficients between math, reading, and writing scores.
•	Helps identify strong relationships (e.g., students good at reading tend to be good at writing).
•	Useful for predictive modeling (if a strong correlation exists, one score can help predict another).
